# VASP inputs for SS-NEB and spontaneous polarization calculations. Structures (in POSCAR and cif formats) along the polarization inversion pathway determined by SS-NEB are also provided. The Python script that use Pymatgen to calculate spontaneous polarization is also provided

Note: [VTST package](https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/) should be used in order to use the provided VASP INCAR for SS-NEB calculations
