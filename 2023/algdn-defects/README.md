# Supporting Information

This repository contains (1) the Special Quasi-random Structures (SQS) used to estimate the alloyg mixing enthalpy of Al<sub>1-x</sub>Gd<sub>x</sub>N alloys and (2) the relaxed structure files for SQS structures of Al<sub>1-x</sub>Gd<sub>x</sub>N alloys (x=0.042, 0.125 and 0.250) and the corresponding defect structures of native defects and O substitutional defects. The structures were relaxed using VASP.

This repository accompanies the paper, [Defect control strategies for Al<sub>1-x</sub>Gd<sub>x</sub>N alloys](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0199191), *J. Appl. Phys.* **135**, 155101 (2024).
