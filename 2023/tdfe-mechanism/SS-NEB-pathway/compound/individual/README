The following materials are calculated based on pathway between positive-parity and non-polar structures due to large amount of required intermediate images:
LiSi2N3
LiGe2N3
Mg2SbN3
Zn2SbN3
Zn2TaN3
Zn2NbN3

ps. The pathway between positive-parity and non-polar structures is symmetriy-equivalent to the one between non-polar and negative-polarity structures for compounds
