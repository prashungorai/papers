# Supporting Information

This repository contains calculated (1) structures along the polarization switching pathway (obtained from solid-state nudged elastic band) for wurtzite (AlN, ZnO) and wurtzite-type (LiGaSe<sub>2</sub>, LiAlS<sub>2</sub>, TiZnN<sub>2</sub>) materials, and (2) corresponding polarization of the structures. The structures are provided in both VASP POSCAR and CIF formats.
