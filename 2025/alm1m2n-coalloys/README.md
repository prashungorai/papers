# Supporting Information

This repository contains (1) the VASP inputs and relaxed structure files of all Al<sub>1−x</sub>(*M1*,*M2*)<sub>x</sub>N co-alloys with *M1*<sup>2+</sup> cations (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr) and *M2*<sup>4+</sup> (Ti, Zr, Hf, Si, Ge) cations, with at *x*  = 0.056, 0.111, 0.167, 0.222, 0.278, (2) Band gaps of Al<sub>1−x</sub>(*M1*,*M2*)<sub>x</sub>N co-alloys calculated using hybrid DFT functional, (3) VASP input files for solid state-nudged elastic band (SS-NEB) calculations and the structures along the minimum energy pathways; the structures are provided in both VASP POSCAR and CIF formats, (4) scripts for calculating the structural distortion. 

This repository accompanies the paper "The More the Better: Al<sub>1−x</sub>(Mg,Hf)<sub>x</sub>N Wurtzite Ferroelectrics Through Co-Alloying".
