# Supporting Information

This repository contains calculated structures along the polarization switching pathway (obtained from solid-state nudged elastic band) for wurtzite-type Al<sub>1-x</sub>Gd<sub>x</sub>N and Al<sub>1-x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>N alloys and the corresponding polarization vs. energy data.  The structures are provided in both VASP POSCAR and CIF formats
